I started programming in R during the second year of my PhD in 2010.

I was finding using the university supplied version of Matlb difficult to use from home, and even moreso when working away from home. 
My github<a href="https://github.com/emkayoh" target="_blank"> repository</a> holds the R code that I wrote to analyse dark adaptation data. 
It relies on a uniform prior distribution and then implements an optimisation routine to estimate the parameters of the model to describe the data.

 This code was the starting point for analysis of dark adaptation data, collected during my PhD.
It has been superceded by other methods written in python, C++ and javascript.
