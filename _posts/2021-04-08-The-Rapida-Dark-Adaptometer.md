<p>We are building a device to help people with early macular disease.
Age related macular disease (AMD) is the commonest cause of vision loss in people over 65 and is growing.
</p>

The disease takes, many forms; 
- Wet
  - profound vision loss
  - monthly ocular injections

- Dry
  - poor vision at night
  - difficulty with glare
  - geographic atrophy
  - drusen
  - treatment being actively researched

<p>
Although currently there is no treatment for dry AMD, many pharmaceutical companies are invetsigating possible therapies.</p>
