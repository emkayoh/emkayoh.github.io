            <p>My first degree was in Ophthalmic Optics at <a href="https://www2.aston.ac.uk/study/courses/optometry-bsc-moptom" target="_blank">Aston University in Birmingham</a>  this allowed me to enter postgraduate training to become an Optometrist.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="items">
            <p>I then became frustrated that I could understand articles written by         <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?ContribAuthorStored=Saunders%2C+H" 
        target="_blank">Saunders</a> but not the counter papers from  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?ContribAuthorStored=Harris%2C+WF" 
 target="_blank">Harris</a>. Both were published by the  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14751313" target="_blank">OPO </a> the journal of Optometry in the UK. So I took a degree in Mathematics at the  <a href="http://open.ac.uk">Open University</a>.

            <p>I was working as an Optometrist and decided I wanted to have a better understanding of my work. I was bored, so I studied for a Masters degree in <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/08335/msc-investigative-ophthalmology-and-vision-science//" target="_blank">Investigative Ophthalmology and Vision Science</a> and I loved it, learned about biochemistry, in particular physiological cascades and monoclonal antibodies. I had a young family and it was a struggle, so when I was invited to take a PhD I had to decline.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="items">
            <p>But, I had another opportunity and I completed a PhD in  <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/programmes/list/10947/phd-mphil-neuroscience/" target="_blank"> Neuroscience</a>. I investigated dark adaptation, the ability that mammals have to see in very low light light. I was also able to develop my understanding of biochemistry and found I was able to apply my mathematical skills and had to learn how to program computers, write shell scripts, learn Fortran, R , C++, LaTeX and countless other skills.</p>
